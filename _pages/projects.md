#### Thermodynamics of information

{% include rightimg_link.html img="tm.png" href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033312" %}

In the past few decades, researchers have uncovered a number of fundamental relationships between information and physics (such relationships often go by the name "thermodynamics of information").  In particular, it has been shown that any physically-embodied system that processes information (which might be anything from a biological organism to a digital computer) must pay a price in terms of physical resources such as energy, time, or memory space. 

Along with [David Wolpert](https://davidwolpert.weebly.com/), resident faculty at the Santa Fe Institute, I have been studying the relationship between information processing and various kinds of resources, both for concrete models of computation (e.g., Turing machines and digital circuits) as well as for the kinds of general stochastic processes used in statistical physics.

#### The physics of agency, function, and meaning

{% include rightimg_link.html img="viability.png" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0041" %}

I am interested in understanding how properties like "agency", "function", and "meaning" --- which are so useful for understanding the behavior of living, cognitive beings --- emerge from an underlying physical world that does not possess such properties. I use formal tools from information theory and statistical physics to approach this question from a mathematical perspective.

In collaboration with [David Wolpert](https://davidwolpert.weebly.com/), I proposed to define and analyze "meaningful information" (also called "semantic information") in terms of statistical correlations which are causally necessary for a physical system to remain out of equilibrium. In future work, I hope to use similar ideas to study the origin of agency, function, and meaning in concrete models of self-maintaining nonequilibrium systems, such as simple models of protocells considered in origin of life research.

#### Machine learning and information theory

{% include rightimg_link.html img="ib.png" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07593" %}

In recent times, new machine learning approaches (such as deep neural networks) have demonstrated revolutionary progress in solving   difficult problems. The theoretical reasons behind this recent progress are not entirely understood, although some have suggested that explanations may be provided by information theory, including the so-called "information bottleneck" principle (which states that optimal prediction of relevant information should be balanced by optimal compression of irrelevant information).

In collaboration with [Brendan Tracey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bYqAaqYAAAAJ&hl=en) and others, I have developed new techniques to accurately estimate information transfer in neural networks. We have used these techniques to train neural networks to compress away irrelevant information, as well as to analyze (and challenge) the idea that information bottleneck explains the success of recent machine learning architectures.

#### Novel information-theoretic measures for complex systems

{% include rightimg_link.html img="pid.png" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08642" %}

I am interested in developing novel ways of quantifying how information is distributed and transferred in complex systems. 
For example, I have proposed a way of measuring how much of the information provided by a set of sources is redundant (i.e., present in all of the sources simultaneously). In another project, done in collaboration with [Bernat Corominas-Murtra](http://www.bernat-corominas-murtra.com/), we proposed a way to   measure the amount of information that is correctly copied from one system to another (e.g., when a genetic sequence is copied without errors).

#### Dissertation research

{% include rightimg_link.html img="pm.png" href="https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.060801" %}


Before coming to the Santa Fe Institute, I did my PhD in complex systems and cognitive science with [Luis M. Rocha](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/rocha/) at the [Center for Complex Systems and Networks](https://cnets.indiana.edu/) in Indiana University, Bloomington. 

In my dissertation, I developed techniques to analyze the notion of "modularity" in distributed dynamical systems.
