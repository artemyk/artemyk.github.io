I am currently a postdoc at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu), a research institute dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complex systems.

In my research, I use techniques from information theory and statistical physics to understand information-processing in various physical and biological complex systems. For more details, see my [research](projects) page. 

For a complete list of publications and preprints, see my  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RmRwJJIAAAAJ) page, or download my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhayq1zlixx3j3v/cv.pdf?dl=1).
