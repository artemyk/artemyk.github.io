I am currently a postdoc at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu), a research institute dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of complex systems.

In my research, I use techniques from information theory and statistical physics to understand information-processing in various physical and biological complex systems. For more details, see my [research](projects) page. 

For a complete list of publications and preprints, see my  {% include scholar_link.html %} page, or download my {% include cv_link.html %}.
