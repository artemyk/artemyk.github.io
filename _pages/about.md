I am a researcher interested in using information theory and statistical physics to understand information processing in various physical and biological complex systems. For more details, see my [research](projects) page. 

I am currently working at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu). Prior to this, I spent several years as a postdoc at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://santafe.edu/), an interdisciplinary research institute dedicated to the study of complex systems, as well as the [Universal Biology Institute](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/UBI/index_e.html), a theoretical biology group at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).
